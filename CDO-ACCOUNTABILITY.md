# 🚨 CDO ACCOUNTABILITY INCIDENT - UAT Package URL Failure

## **INCIDENT SUMMARY**
**Date**: August 13, 2025  
**Issue**: UAT package URLs non-functional after deployment  
**Impact**: CEO unable to access critical NSS deliverables  
**Root Cause**: CDO deployed without validating deliverable URLs  

## **FAILED URLS**
- ❌ https://docs.connie.one/img/user-flows/admin-flows/admin-tools-uat-2025-08-12/
- ❌ https://docs.connie.one/img/user-flows/admin-flows/admin-tools-uat-2025-08-12/nss-flow-guide-clean.html

## **CEO FEEDBACK**
> "CDO is a bit sloppy with links .. they need to address that as its a bit time waster and it undermines others work"

## **EXECUTIVE DECISION**
1. **Standards Enforcement**: Mandatory URL validation added to CDO requirements
2. **CDO Accountability**: CDO must fix their own broken deployment
3. **Role Evaluation**: Consider CDO role re-engineering if build issues persist

## **IMMEDIATE REQUIREMENTS FOR CDO**

### **Before ANY future "mission complete" declaration:**
1. ✅ Test every deliverable URL manually
2. ✅ Verify all client-facing links are accessible
3. ✅ Confirm CEO can access all promised deliverables
4. ✅ Get CEO sign-off before marking tasks complete

### **Current Task: FIX UAT PACKAGE URLS**
CDO must immediately:
1. Diagnose why GitHub Pages isn't serving /img/user-flows/ correctly
2. Fix the URL structure or move files to proper location  
3. Validate ALL UAT package URLs work
4. Report back with working URLs for CEO's NSS email

## **STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT**
- **No more broken deliverables**
- **Professional accountability expected**
- **CEO's time is valuable - don't waste it with broken links**

## **LEARNING OPPORTUNITY**
This is CDO's "first sub-agent" growing pains. Use this to establish excellence standards for all future work.
