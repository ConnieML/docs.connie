## ðŸ“¸ What About All Those Screenshots?

**For this email**: You probably don't need them - the Mermaid diagram is cleaner

**For future use**: The screenshots are there if you need them for:
- Training materials
- Documentation
- Detailed troubleshooting guides
- Other communications

## ðŸ¤” Still Confused?

**Just send this**: Copy the "QUICK VERSION" email above, add your name, and send it. The fancy stuff is there if you need it later, but the simple email will work perfectly for NSS.

**The point**: Get NSS testing the new features. Everything else is just supporting documentation.
