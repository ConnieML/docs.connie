**Subject**: New Admin Tools Available for UAT - Quick Test Request

Hi NSS Team,

We've deployed new admin tools to your Connie platform for testing. Takes just 2 minutes to explore and your feedback is invaluable!

### What's New in v2.0:
- **Centralized Admin Tools & Data hub** - Everything in one place
- **Improved layout** - Better visibility in your CRM container
- **Live data integration** - Real voicemail playback and fax viewing
- **Quick access buttons** - Streamlined navigation to key functions

### How to Test:
1. **Open your ConnieRTC/CRM Container** (as you normally do)
2. **Navigate to Admin Tools & Data** (new centralized entry point)
3. **Try both paths**: Channel Manager and Data & Reporting
4. **Test the live features**: Play a voicemail, view a fax
5. **Let us know what you think!**

### What You'll See:
The attached flow diagram shows exactly what to expect as you navigate through the new interface. Everything is now live with your real NSS data.

### Key Testing Points:
- Does the layout look good in your system?
- Is navigation intuitive and easy to follow?
- Do the voicemail and fax features work as expected?
- Any suggestions for improvement?
