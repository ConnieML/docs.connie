4. Test in your development environment
5. Deploy to production

## Best Practices

- **Test Thoroughly**: Use your sandbox environment before production
- **Monitor Usage**: Track costs and performance metrics
- **Train Staff**: Ensure your team understands new features
- **Document Changes**: Keep your configuration documented

## Cost Considerations

Most voice add-ons incur additional costs:
