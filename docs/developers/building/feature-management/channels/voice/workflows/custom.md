# Custom Build Workflow

Create a unique voice experience tailored to your organization's specific needs using Twilio Studio Flows.

## Overview

The Custom Build option gives you complete control over your voice workflow by letting you design your own Twilio Studio Flow from scratch. This is perfect for organizations with unique requirements that don't fit the standard workflows.

## When to Use Custom Build

Choose Custom Build when you need:

- Complex routing logic based on multiple conditions
- Integration with specific external systems during the call
- Unique IVR menus with custom branching
- Advanced call handling scenarios
- Specialized compliance or reporting needs

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

### Basic Setup

1. **Create a New Studio Flow**
   - Log into your Twilio Console
   - Navigate to Studio Flows
