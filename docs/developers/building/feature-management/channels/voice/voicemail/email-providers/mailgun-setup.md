---

## Prerequisites

### Required Access:
- ✅ Admin access to your organization's Connie deployment
- ✅ Access to your client's domain DNS settings  
- ✅ Your client's admin email address

### Accounts Needed:
- ✅ Mailgun account (free tier supports 100 emails/day)
- ✅ Domain registrar access (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)

:::tip New to Connie?
This guide assumes you have basic familiarity with environment configuration. If you're new, allow extra time for the DNS setup steps.
:::

---

## Step 1: Client Information Gathering

Before starting, collect this information from your client:

```bash
# CLIENT CONFIGURATION TEMPLATE
# Copy this and fill in your client's actual values

CLIENT_ORGANIZATION_NAME="Your Client's Organization Name"
CLIENT_DOMAIN="clientdomain.com" 
CLIENT_ADMIN_EMAIL="admin@clientdomain.com"
CLIENT_PHONE_NUMBER="+18005551234"

# You'll create these in the next steps:
MAILGUN_DOMAIN="voicemail.clientdomain.com"
MAILGUN_API_KEY="[Will be generated]"
```

---

## Step 2: Mailgun Account Setup

### Create Mailgun Account

1. Go to [mailgun.com](https://mailgun.com) and create an account
2. Choose **US** region (recommended for most clients)
3. Verify your email and complete account setup

### Add Your Client's Domain

**Use a dedicated subdomain** for best deliverability:

1. **Recommended format:** `voicemail.[clientdomain].com`
2. **Example:** If client domain is `helpinghand.org`, use `voicemail.helpinghand.org`

**Setup steps:**
1. In Mailgun dashboard → **Sending** → **Domains**
2. Click **Add New Domain**
3. Enter: `voicemail.[YOUR_CLIENT_DOMAIN]`
4. Select **US** region
5. Click **Add Domain**

### Configure DNS Records

Mailgun will provide DNS records. Add these to your client's domain:

```dns
# Example DNS records (yours will be different)
Type: TXT
Name: voicemail.helpinghand.org
Value: v=spf1 include:mailgun.org ~all

Type: TXT
Name: smtp._domainkey.voicemail.helpinghand.org  
Value: k=rsa; p=MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQ...

Type: CNAME
Name: email.voicemail.helpinghand.org
Value: mailgun.org

Type: MX
Name: voicemail.helpinghand.org
Value: 10 mxa.mailgun.org
```

:::warning DNS Propagation Time
DNS changes take 1-24 hours to propagate. You can check verification status in Mailgun dashboard under **Domains** → **Domain Verification**.
:::

### Get Your Sending API Key

:::warning Critical: Use Domain-Specific Sending Key
**Do NOT use the Private API key from Settings → API Keys.** You need a domain-specific sending key for the email functionality to work properly.
:::

After your domain is created and DNS records are configured:

1. **Navigate to your domain:** Mailgun dashboard → **Sending** → **Domains** 
2. **Click on your domain** (e.g., `voicemail.clientdomain.com`)
3. **Go to Domain Settings:** Click **Domain settings** button
4. **Access Sending Keys:** Click the **Sending keys** tab

![Mailgun Domain Settings - Sending Keys Tab](/img/mailgun/mailgun-sending-keys-tab.png)

5. **Create a sending key:** Click **Add sending key**
6. **Copy both values:**
   - **Key ID** (e.g., `45de04af-85e71f21`) 
   - **API Send Key** (long string starting with various prefixes)

![Mailgun Sending Key Details](/img/mailgun/mailgun-sending-key-details.png)

7. **Use the API Send Key** for your `MAILGUN_API_KEY` environment variable
8. Save both the Key ID and API Send Key in a secure location

### Test Mailgun Setup

:::danger CRITICAL: Test API Before Deployment
**This step prevents 90% of deployment failures.** You MUST verify API credentials work before proceeding.
:::

**Use this exact command to test:**

```bash
# TEST MAILGUN API BEFORE DEPLOYMENT
curl -s -w "\nHTTP Status: %{http_code}\n" --user "api:[YOUR_SENDING_API_KEY]" \
    https://api.mailgun.net/v3/[YOUR_DOMAIN]/messages \
    -F from='Test <test@[YOUR_DOMAIN]>' \
    -F to='[ADMIN_EMAIL]' \
    -F subject='Pre-Deployment API Test' \
    -F text='If you receive this, Mailgun API is working correctly.'
```

**Expected result:**
```json
{"id":"<20250722104855.38483d1186b94dc9@yourdomain.com>","message":"Queued. Thank you."}
HTTP Status: 200
```

:::danger STOP if you get:
- **HTTP 401**: Wrong API key - use domain-specific sending key
- **HTTP 404**: Domain not found - check domain configuration  
- **Any other error**: Do NOT proceed with deployment
:::

**API Key Type Verification:**
- ✅ **Domain Sending Key**: `65cca1c374d5df6329441cabc102ac86-45de04af-f8ba43f2` 
- ❌ **Private API Key**: `key-1234567890abcdef` (DON'T USE THIS)

---

## Step 3: Pre-Deployment Checklist

:::danger STOP: Complete This Checklist First
Before proceeding, ensure you have ALL of the following information:
:::

**✅ Twilio Account Details:**
- [ ] Account SID (format: `AC...`)
- [ ] Auth Token
- [ ] Twilio CLI profile configured and active

**✅ Twilio Flex Configuration:**
- [ ] Workspace SID (format: `WS...`)
- [ ] "Assign to Anyone" Workflow SID (format: `WW...`)

**✅ Mailgun Configuration:**
- [ ] Domain verified (DNS records propagated)
- [ ] API test successful (Step 2)
- [ ] Domain-specific sending API key saved

**✅ Client Information:**
- [ ] Phone number to configure
- [ ] Admin email address(es) for notifications

---

## Step 4: Configure Template Feature

The voicemail-with-email functionality is **already built into your ConnieRTC template**. You just need to configure it.

### Update Environment Variables

In your Connie deployment, add these environment variables to Twilio Functions:

```bash
# REQUIRED ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
# Add these to your Twilio Functions environment

ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@clientdomain.com
MAILGUN_DOMAIN=voicemail.clientdomain.com  
MAILGUN_API_KEY=your-mailgun-sending-api-key

# For multiple admin emails (separate emails sent to each):
# ADMIN_EMAIL=admin1@domain.com,admin2@domain.com
```

:::warning Use the Sending API Key
The `MAILGUN_API_KEY` must be the **API Send Key** from the domain's Sending keys tab, NOT the Private API key from Settings → API Keys.
:::

:::info Multiple Admin Emails
To send notifications to multiple administrators, use comma-separated emails. The system sends **separate emails** to each recipient for better reliability.
:::

**How to add environment variables:**
1. Twilio Console → **Functions & Assets** → **Services**
2. Select your ConnieRTC serverless service
3. **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. Add the three variables above

### Update Feature Configuration

Enable the feature in your Flex configuration:

```json
{
  "features": {
    "callback_and_voicemail_with_email": {
      "enabled": true,
      "allow_requeue": true,
      "max_attempts": 3,
      "auto_select_task": false,
      "enable_email_notifications": true
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Step 5: Critical Code Update

:::danger CRITICAL: Update Workflow SID
**This is the #1 cause of "option not available" errors.** You MUST update the hardcoded workflow SID before deployment.
:::

### Update Wait Experience Function

**File**: `/serverless-functions/src/functions/features/callback-and-voicemail-with-email/studio/wait-experience.protected.js`  
**Line**: ~135

```javascript
// TEMPORARY FIX: Hardcode workflow SID to bypass buggy queue friendlyName logic
const enqueuedWorkflowSid = 'WW...'; // YOUR "Assign to Anyone" workflow SID
```

**How to find your workflow SID:**
1. Twilio Console → **TaskRouter** → **Workspaces**
2. Select your Flex workspace
3. Click **Workflows**
4. Find "Assign to Anyone" workflow
5. Copy the SID (starts with `WW`)

**Example:**
```javascript
// Before (will cause failures):
const enqueuedWorkflowSid = 'WW3657f8c5b384cdad9c6d37cbaedd1013'; // HHOVV workflow

// After (updated for your account):
const enqueuedWorkflowSid = 'WW68ed6f6bc555f21e436810af747722a9'; // Your workflow
```

---

## Step 6: Deploy the Implementation

### Deploy Serverless Functions

```bash
# Navigate to your ConnieRTC template directory
cd serverless-functions

# Deploy the updated functions with your new environment variables
npm run deploy
```

**Deployment output will show:**
```
domain            custom-flex-extensions-serverless-XXXX-dev.twil.io
...
protected /features/callback-and-voicemail-with-email/studio/send-voicemail-email
protected /features/callback-and-voicemail-with-email/studio/wait-experience
```

:::tip Note Your Deployment Domain
Copy the domain URL (e.g., `custom-flex-extensions-serverless-4044-dev.twil.io`). You'll need this for Studio Flow configuration and monitoring.
:::

### Verify Environment Variables Deployed

```bash
# List deployed environment variables
twilio api:serverless:v1:services:environments:variables:list \
  --service-sid ZS... \
  --environment-sid ZE...
```

**Look for:**
- `ADMIN_EMAIL`
- `MAILGUN_DOMAIN`  
- `MAILGUN_API_KEY`

### Apply Infrastructure Changes

```bash
# Navigate to terraform directory
cd infra-as-code/terraform/environments/default

# Enable the callback-and-voicemail-with-email module in your tfvars
# Add this line to your local.tfvars:
# callback_and_voicemail_with_email_enabled = true

# Apply the changes
terraform plan -var-file="local.tfvars"
terraform apply -var-file="local.tfvars"
```

This creates:
- ✅ TaskRouter workflow for callback/voicemail routing
- ✅ Studio Flow with email integration  
- ✅ All required serverless functions

:::info Correct Terminology
In the Studio Flow Send to Flex widget, the field is called **"Hold Music TwiML URL"** (NOT "Wait URL"). This URL handles the caller experience while waiting in queue.

### Connect to Phone Number

1. Twilio Console → **Phone Numbers** → **Active Numbers**
2. Click your client's phone number
3. **Voice Configuration** → **A call comes in**
4. Select the new Studio Flow: **"Template Example Callback With Email Flow"**
5. Save configuration

:::tip Studio Flow Not Appearing?
If the Studio Flow doesn't appear in the dropdown, use the CLI method:

```bash
# Create flow JSON file
cat > callback-voicemail-email-flow.json << 'EOF'
{
  "description": "Callback and Voicemail with Email Flow",
  "states": [
    {
      "name": "Trigger",
      "type": "trigger",
      "transitions": [
        {"event": "incomingMessage"},
        {"next": "send_to_flex_1", "event": "incomingCall"},
        {"event": "incomingConversationMessage"},
        {"event": "incomingRequest"},
        {"event": "incomingParent"}
      ],
      "properties": {"offset": {"x": -70, "y": -60}}
    },
    {
      "name": "send_to_flex_1",
      "type": "send-to-flex",
      "transitions": [
        {"event": "callComplete"},
        {"event": "failedToEnqueue"},
        {"event": "callFailure"}
      ],
      "properties": {
        "waitUrl": "https://YOUR-DEPLOYMENT-DOMAIN/features/callback-and-voicemail-with-email/studio/wait-experience",
        "offset": {"x": 170, "y": 100},
        "workflow": "YOUR-WORKFLOW-SID",
        "channel": "voice",
        "attributes": "{\"call_sid\": \"{{trigger.call.CallSid}}\", \"callBackData\": {\"attempts\": 0}}",
        "waitUrlMethod": "POST"
      }
    }
  ],
  "initial_state": "Trigger",
  "flags": {"allow_concurrent_calls": true}
}
EOF

# Replace YOUR-DEPLOYMENT-DOMAIN and YOUR-WORKFLOW-SID

# Create the flow
twilio api:studio:v2:flows:create \
  --friendly-name "Callback and Voicemail with Email Flow" \
  --status published \
  --definition "$(cat callback-voicemail-email-flow.json)"
```

## Step 7: Automated Testing

### Pre-Deployment Test Script

Use the comprehensive test script to validate your deployment:

```bash
# Navigate to your ConnieRTC directory
cd /path/to/connieRTC-basecamp

# Set your configuration variables
export ACCOUNT_SID="AC..."
export PHONE_NUMBER="+1..."
export ADMIN_EMAIL="admin@clientdomain.com"
export MAILGUN_DOMAIN="voicemail.clientdomain.com" 
export MAILGUN_API_KEY="your-domain-sending-api-key"
export DEPLOYMENT_DOMAIN="custom-flex-extensions-serverless-XXXX-dev.twil.io"
export WORKFLOW_SID="WW..."

# Run the comprehensive test
./test-voicemail-email-workflow.sh
```

**The script validates:**
- ✅ Twilio CLI configuration
- ✅ Mailgun API credentials  
- ✅ Serverless function deployment
- ✅ Environment variables
- ✅ Studio Flow configuration

:::tip Automated Verification
This test script catches 90% of configuration issues before manual testing, saving significant troubleshooting time.
:::

---

## Step 8: Manual Test Your Implementation

### Complete Test Workflow

1. **Call the client's number**
2. **Listen to the greeting** and wait for options
3. **Press * (star)** during hold music
4. **Press 2** for voicemail option
5. **Leave a test message** (say your name and timestamp)
6. **Hang up**

### Expected Results

**In Flex:**
- Voicemail task appears in the queue
- Task contains recording and transcription
- Agents can handle normally

**In Email:**
- Email arrives at admin address within 1-2 minutes
- Subject: "New Voicemail from [phone number]"
- Body includes all call details and transcription
- .wav audio file attached

**Sample Email Content:**
```
New voicemail received:

From: +15105551234
To: +18005551234
Date: 2024-01-15T14:30:00.000Z
Recording ID: REabc123...

Transcription:
Hi, this is John testing the voicemail system at 2:30 PM.

The audio recording is attached to this email.

---
This is an automated message. Please do not reply.
```

---

## Step 9: Production Optimization

### Monitoring Setup

**Function URLs for Real-Time Monitoring:**
- **Email Function Logs**: `https://[YOUR-DEPLOYMENT-DOMAIN]/features/callback-and-voicemail-with-email/studio/send-voicemail-email`
- **Call Flow Logs**: `https://[YOUR-DEPLOYMENT-DOMAIN]/features/callback-and-voicemail-with-email/studio/wait-experience`

**Access logs via:**
1. Twilio Console → **Functions & Assets** → **Services** → Your Service → **Environment** → **Live Logs**
2. Or use CLI: `twilio serverless:logs --service-sid ZS... --environment-sid ZE...`

**Check these regularly:**
- Mailgun dashboard for delivery rates
- Twilio Function logs for errors
- DNS record status

**Monthly maintenance:**
- Test complete voicemail-to-email flow
- Review Mailgun usage and costs
- Verify DNS records unchanged

### Performance Considerations

**File Size Handling:**
- Files under 20MB: Attached directly
- Files over 20MB: Download link provided
- Automatic timeout protection

**Email Delivery:**
- Typical delivery: 1-5 seconds
- Free tier: 100 emails/day
- Paid plans available for higher volume

## Troubleshooting

### Common Failure Points & Solutions

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "Option not available at this time" | Wrong/missing workflow SID | Update wait-experience.protected.js line 135 |
| 401/403 email errors | Wrong API key type | Use domain sending key, not private key |
| Flow not in phone config | Creation failed in Console | Use CLI method in Step 5 |
| No environment vars in Console | Browser cache/wrong environment | Verify with CLI, refresh browser |

### No Email Received

**First check for authentication errors:**
```bash
# Test API directly
curl -s -w "\nHTTP Status: %{http_code}\n" --user "api:[YOUR_KEY]" \
    https://api.mailgun.net/v3/[YOUR_DOMAIN]/messages \
    -F from='Test <test@[YOUR_DOMAIN]>' \
    -F to='[ADMIN_EMAIL]' \
    -F subject='Debug Test' \
    -F text='Testing email delivery'
```

**Check Mailgun logs:**
1. Mailgun dashboard → **Logs**
2. Look for your test email
3. Check delivery status

**Common issues:**
- DNS records not propagated (wait 24 hours)
- Wrong API key format (using private key instead of sending key)
- Admin email in spam folder

### Email Without Attachment

**Check Function logs:**
1. Twilio Console → **Functions** → **Logs**
2. Look for voicemail function execution
3. Check for download errors

**Common issues:**
- Recording URL not accessible
- Network timeout during download
- File size exceeded limits

### Voicemail Task Not Created

**This indicates email integration broke the core functionality:**
1. Check Function logs for errors
2. Verify all environment variables present
3. Test with original callback-and-voicemail feature

**Quick fix:**
- Disable email temporarily by removing ADMIN_EMAIL environment variable
- Redeploy functions
- Test core voicemail functionality

---

## Cost Planning

### Mailgun Costs
- **Free tier:** 100 emails/day
- **Flex plans:** Start at $35/month for 1,250/month
- **Pay-as-you-go:** Available for variable volume

### Estimating Volume
- Average organization: 5-20 voicemails/day
- High-volume organizations: 50+ voicemails/day
- Plan accordingly for your client's expected usage

---

## Security Best Practices

### API Key Management
- Store keys in Twilio Functions environment variables only
- Never commit keys to code repositories  
- Rotate keys quarterly
- Use separate keys for testing vs production

### Email Security
- Use dedicated subdomain (voicemail.domain.com)
- Implement all DNS security records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
- Monitor DNS for unauthorized changes
- Set up proper reverse DNS

### Data Privacy
- Voicemail recordings contain sensitive data
- Ensure Mailgun account complies with client's privacy requirements
- Consider email encryption for sensitive environments
- Implement retention policies
