## 📊 Carrier-Agnostic Architecture

ConnieRTC's fax implementation follows our carrier-agnostic philosophy:

```mermaid

    A[Fax Number] --> B[ConnieRTC Routing]
    B --> C{Provider Selection}
    C --> D[Sinch Primary]
    C --> E[Backup Provider]
    D --> F[Delivery]
    E --> F
    F --> G[Email/Flex/Integration]
```

This ensures:

| 100-1000 faxes | Option B | Task routing helps manage volume |
| > 1000 faxes | Option C | Automation and integration critical |
