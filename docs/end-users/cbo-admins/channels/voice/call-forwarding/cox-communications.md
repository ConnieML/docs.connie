# Forward Cox Communications Business Phone to Connie

This guide walks you through setting up call forwarding from your Cox Communications business phone number to your Connie phone system.

## Prerequisites

- ✅ Active Cox Communications business phone service
- ✅ Connie phone number (provided by your Connie administrator)
- ✅ Access to Cox Business Portal or phone system settings
- ✅ Administrative access to your Cox account

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Access Cox Business Portal

1. Go to [Cox Business Portal](https://business.cox.com)
2. Sign in with your Cox business account credentials
3. Navigate to "Phone Services" or "Voice Services"

### 2. Configure Call Forwarding

1. Locate your business phone number in the portal
2. Look for "Call Forwarding" or "Forward Calls" settings
3. Enable call forwarding
4. Enter your Connie phone number as the forwarding destination

### 3. Set Forwarding Rules

Configure when calls should be forwarded:
- **Always Forward**: All calls go directly to Connie
- **Forward When Busy**: Only forward when your Cox line is busy
- **Forward When No Answer**: Forward after a specified number of rings
- **Forward When Unreachable**: Forward when service is unavailable

### 4. Test the Setup

1. Call your Cox business number from an external phone
2. Verify the call reaches your Connie system
3. Test different forwarding scenarios if applicable

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Calls not forwarding:**
- Verify the Connie phone number is entered correctly
- Check that call forwarding is enabled
- Ensure your Cox service supports call forwarding

**Calls forwarding but not reaching Connie:**
- Contact your Connie administrator to verify the number is configured
- Check for any geographic restrictions on the forwarding number

**Partial forwarding:**
- Review your forwarding rules to ensure they match your needs
- Test different call scenarios (busy, no answer, etc.)

## Important Notes

- Call forwarding charges may apply from Cox Communications
- Some Cox business plans include free call forwarding
- You can disable forwarding at any time through the Cox portal
- Keep your Cox service active - canceling it will stop call forwarding
