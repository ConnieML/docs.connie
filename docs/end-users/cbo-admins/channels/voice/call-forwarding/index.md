# Business Call Forwarding to Connie

## Introduction

We're excited to offer your nonprofit a modern, flexible call center experience using Connie—without requiring you to move your main business phone number from your current provider. Forwarding your business phone number allows you quickly and easily start leveraging most of Connie's features, while ensuring no disruption to your callers and minimal risk to your operations. 

Business call forwarding is a great way to kick off your Connie journey, but it is not recommended as a permanent setup. Please read on to learn more about how call forwarding works or contact the Connie Care team to discuss your strategy.

**The Process**:
- **Keep Your Main Number**: Your existing business number remains with your current provider
- **Forward Calls**: Your provider forwards all incoming calls to a new Connie number
- **Answer in Connie**: Your team answers calls within Connie's platform, leveraging advanced features tailored for nonprofit efficiency
- **Outbound Calls**: Your main number appears as the caller ID for outbound calls, maintaining consistency
- **Seamless Integration**: Experience all of Connie's features without disrupting your existing phone setup

## Detailed Steps for Call Forwarding to Connie

To forward your current business number to Connie, you'll need to either **PORT** the number to Connie or **FORWARD** calls from your existing provider to your Connie number. 

If porting isn't an option yet, or you wish to take a more staged approach to your Connie transition, you can set up call forwarding through your existing provider, directing calls to your Connie number. Connie also allows you to configure call forwarding rules within your account, including setting specific forwarding numbers and ring times.
